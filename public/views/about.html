        <h1>About</h1>
          <p class="flow-text">Premier Track Club is a competitive track and field club that participates in USA Track and Field, AAU, and TAAF track events at various locations within the Dallas Fort Worth Metroplex . We accept male and female applicants between the ages of eight and nineteen and we encourage parental participation. Although we are a competitive club, we accept all athletes and do not reject applicates based on performance or ability. We emphasize a solid, technical education in proper running technique for each race distance and build on these mechanics throughout the program's duration. Premier Track Club has competed in Dallas over the past ten years and we look forward to working with you and your athlete as we have fun breaking old and setting new personal records.</p>
